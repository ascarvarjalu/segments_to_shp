# segments_to_shp

This is a simple, not-so-sophisticated workflow to convert the output of the `networksegment` TopoToolbox function into a shapefile.

The process is divided into two parts:

### 1. `river_segments_indx.m` (MATLAB)
This script uses the `networksegment` function along with a few custom MATLAB operations to compute segment index values. It outputs a `.csv` file (named `myData.csv`), containing the necessary information to later generate a shapefile.

### 2. `shp_segments_indx.py` (Python in QGIS environment)
This script reads `myData.csv` and converts it into a shapefile using the `pointstopath` tool available in QGIS (via the Processing Toolbox).

ðŸ’¡ **Note:**  
Make sure you change the path and filename according to your workstation, and the CRS in the `shp_segments_indx.py` code.

If you have trouble running the Python script directly, you can also copy and paste the code, line by line, into the QGIS Python Console to execute it manually.
